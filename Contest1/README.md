# NEO-NATION

All of us …if you want to be. NEO-NATION is a band of #DLT #Rebel #Developers devoted to creating disruptive applications on the #Blockchain. We’re inspired by a set of principles similar to those of Kenny Chesney’s #NoShoesNation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-01jhW_Yzhs).

*We work for a token here, a token there. We work for fun.*

## NEO-NATION The #BestOfTheBest #TripleD Programming Contest #1

What is the #BestOfTheBest #TripleD Programming Contest #1?

* It is the first contest designed to help find the first Best-of-the-Best DumbData Developer.
* Blockchain DumbData is secure, immutable, auditable, historized data written directly into a blockchain **without** using a smart contract - vs. Smart Data that is merely *represented* on a blockchain using a smart contract). DumbData is more secure and more reliable than Smart Data; the latter can easily be lost during hard forks, bugs, and unreliable blockchain platform upgrades.
