# NEO-NATION

All of us …if you want to be. NEO-NATION is a band of #DLT #Rebel #Developers devoted to creating disruptive applications on the #Blockchain. We’re inspired by a set of principles similar to those of Kenny Chesney’s #NoShoesNation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-01jhW_Yzhs).

*We work for a token here, a token there. We work for fun.*

## NEO-NATION The #BestOfTheBest #TripleD Programming Contest #1

What is the #BestOfTheBest #TripleD Programming Contest #1?

* It is the first contest designed to help find the first Best-of-the-Best DumbData Developer.
* DumbData is secure, immutable, auditable, historized data written directly into a blockchain without using a smart contract (in contrast with Smart Data that is *represented* on a blockchain by using a smart contract to represent the data).
