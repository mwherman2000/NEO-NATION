# NEO-NATION

All of us …if you want to be. NEO-NATION is a band of #DLT #Rebel #Developers devoted to creating disruptive applications on the #Blockchain. We’re inspired by a set of principles similar to those of Kenny Chesney’s #NoShoesNation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-01jhW_Yzhs).

*We work for a token here, a token there. We work for fun.*
